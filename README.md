# Where did 'Neimart' come from?

When the COVID pandemic broke out, the traditional learning system had various challenges, with a significant change in individuals choosing e-learning over traditional learning paths, making online learning more of a requirement than an option. So, I decided to also work on an educational platform to allow students to study a variety of courses and topics using interactive checkpoints, lectures, and videos, with certificates automatically generated at the completion of each course. Since the word **Academy** means a place of study or training in a special field while **Ours** may simply refer to something that is belongs to us. (Academy of Ours)
